This is a REPO  created from my terminal on linux following instructions from ALX Day 2 git project.
It has a directory 0x03 that includes bash,c and js directories and also this readme file.
I believe the whole process and project sharpen my unix skills everytime I code.
Its a great experience and l would encourage anyone to give it a shot.
I do hard things!!!
